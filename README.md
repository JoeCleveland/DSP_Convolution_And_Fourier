## Introduction

This project demonstrates the application of convolution and Fourier transform in DSP. It includes examples and explanations to help understand these concepts.

## Convolution

Convolution is a mathematical operation used to express the relation between input and output of an LTI system. This section covers:

- Definition and properties
- Examples
- Applications

## Fourier Transform

The Fourier transform is a mathematical transform that decomposes functions depending on space or time into functions depending on spatial or temporal frequency. This section covers:

- Definition and properties
- Examples
- Applications

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Instructions on how to use the project will be provided here.
